Here is a list of coding projects I have written. You can find more details and source files on my [GitHub](https://github.com/rbagd) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/rbagd) accounts.

* [Tool](http://spark.rstudio.com/rytis/inflation) for visualizing price inflation in Belgium. Written in `R` with `shiny` and `lattice`.
* This website. It is powered by `Jekyll` and written in `markdown`. Its source code is [here](https://bitbucket.org/rbagd/perso-uclouvain).
